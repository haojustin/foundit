# Feedback Grouped and Sorted

1) I like their integration of modals and camera views and projected future features. I think something cool would be being able to star/review people who post lost things and give them badges or ratings. It would be good to protect people from malicious actors and also give people a reason to post lost items.

Many people enyjoed our camera and modal features. 

2) Add functionality, right now it's very barren and only ui

Another common theme was that we need more features and buttons in our app. 

3) Really useful app. If it is built successfully, I might use it (my left AirPod is still lost now).

The overall concept and idea was the most common piece of feedback. 

4) Improve the map function and integrate the map with other feature so that it has more clear function in this app.

People have suggested integrating the map with the other features in the app. 

5) I think this idea is really interesting. I think a chat feature would be really nice since it'd be much easier than having to connect through email. I'm wondering if you will collaborate with the lost and founds on campus currently and if users who lost stuff can also post.

Many viewers also wanted a built-in chat feature so users could talk to each other about their items.
