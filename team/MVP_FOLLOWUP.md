# Feedback Grouped and Sorted

1) I like their integration of modals and camera views and projected future features. I think something cool would be being able to star/review people who post lost things and give them badges or ratings. It would be good to protect people from malicious actors and also give people a reason to post lost items.

Many people enyjoed our camera and modal features. 

2) Add functionality, right now it's very barren and only ui

Another common theme was that we need more features and buttons in our app. 

3) Really useful app. If it is built successfully, I might use it (my left AirPod is still lost now).

The overall concept and idea was the most common piece of feedback. 

4) Improve the map function and integrate the map with other feature so that it has more clear function in this app.

People have suggested integrating the map with the other features in the app. 

5) I think this idea is really interesting. I think a chat feature would be really nice since it'd be much easier than having to connect through email. I'm wondering if you will collaborate with the lost and founds on campus currently and if users who lost stuff can also post.

Many viewers also wanted a built-in chat feature so users could talk to each other about their items. 

# Response Actions

1) The camera is our best feature currently but should be upgraded somewhat.
2) The UI is defintely too sparse right now, and we have more features planned.
3) The overall concept was very good and we are progressing toward a final product.
4) Our map function needs to be integrated with actual map items so that users can post.
5) Users should definetly be able to communicate with each other in-app without having to leave the app. 

# Next Steps

1) We need to allow the user to have a full screen preview of the picture they take.
2) We will use AI tools to quickly add more features and populate our app with more buttons such as an account page and settings page.
3) We will continue progressing on our idea toward a final product.
4) The map function will be integrated with the posts so users can either pin the location on the map or get a geocoded address of where they posted from.
5) We will add a robust chat feature so users can communicate with each other in the app.
