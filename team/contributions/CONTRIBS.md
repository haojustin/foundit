I made the settings page. The post page involved mainly me and Justin. I'm also responsible for improving the UI and keeping its design consistent across the app. The commits graph seems accurate. It does say I have a lot of lines coded,
but the number is inflated due to automated changes in certain files due to installing dependencies and such.
