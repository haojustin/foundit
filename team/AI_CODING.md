Baimin Wang:
  I used ChatGPT to help me construct HomePage UI using react-native. I am not familiar with all the packages included in react/react-native, ChatGPT gave great advices about which ones I should use and how to use them. For instance, **useEffect, useState** are the packages that GPT recommended me to use so I can update the content presented in HomePage asynchronously with the backend Firebase data. 
    By incorporating packages introduced by ChatGPT, I was able to construct an ideal UI for HomePage. I learned many things from chatGPT as it taught me how each variable in the stylesheet, in effect packages, means I can manipulate parameters based on the knowledge acquired. However, AI produces ambivalent content, I need to continuously run the program it provided for me to test any bugs including naming different, outdated usages, or any possible errors. Sometimes asking AI to self-correct by constantly raising questions can also be effective.
