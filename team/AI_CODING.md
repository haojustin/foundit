- I used ChatGPT to help me construct HomePage UI using react-native. I am not familiar with all the packages included in react/react-native, ChatGPT gave great advices about which ones I should use and how to use them. For instance, **useEffect, useState** are the packages that GPT recommended me to use so I can update the content presented in HomePage asynchronously with the backend Firebase data. 
- By incorporating packages introduced by ChatGPT, I was able to construct an ideal UI for HomePage. I learned many things from chatGPT as it taught me how each variable in the stylesheet, in effect packages, means I can manipulate parameters based on the knowledge acquired. However, AI produces ambivalent content, I need to continuously run the program it provided for me to test any bugs including naming different, outdated usages, or any possible errors. Sometimes asking AI to self-correct by constantly raising questions can also be effective.

I used ChatGPT to help me set up the unit test for Lab 5. It did generate the unit test code, but was quite useless for helping me actually set up the testing system. Ended up spending 5 hours throwing random extremely specific and esoteric bits of code from the internet at the problem until some combination of those bits apparently made it work. So I guess you could say that's a limitation of the AI. It's good at helping generate lots of surface-level, common, basic code, such as unit tests, and we definitely will be using it for those in the future, but it cannot hope to match the kind of ancient knowledge that may be found in decade old StackOverflow posts. Additionally, AI can't generate code exactly for your purpose. In the time it would take to engineer a prompt to generate the perfect code you needed that worked right out of the box, one could easily just adapt an imperfect generation to their purposes.

I used ChatGPT to help me create components for my sign-in page, It helps me set all the text boxes, add alerts, and add placeholders. It also teaches me how to do navigation stuff using stack navigator. I found ChatGPT really helpful in terms of coding for these basic components.

I used Google Bard to help me retrieve the React Native user's location. Google Bard recommended an obscure library with with weird dependencies that made the entire project very difficult to manage. I was able to get a map feature working, but the coordiantes were wrong and I couldn't moveo utside of the Bay Area. I used ChatGPT next to try to write the code. It gave me the built-in React Native library and it integrated into the project quickly and easily. The dependencies were already built into our project and I was able to get a funcitnoal map into our app. ChatGPT did not have the locaiton-based errros the Google Bard code did.

I used chatgpt to help me understand the react native stack navigator. I watched a lot of YouTube videos but I still had trouble with moving between pages on our app. Eventually, I entered specific chunks of my post codebase and it was able to give me a breakdown of possible implementations. Although the implementations weren't copy-paste-ready since they required implementation in different files that depended on each other, it gave me an idea of how to approach it.

**Kendrick Lee:**  
I used ChatGPT to help me make the profile page UI within the tab bar. I was also having difficulty with linking the settings page into the profile page as a button since the settings page would still show up on the tab bar even though I thought I removed it. I used ChatGPT to help me hide the settings page on the tab bar feature and link the page to a button, which I had previously linked on the wrong page.
