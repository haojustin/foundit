Our tech stack is React Native on the frontend and Google Firebase on the backend. 

Some team members are familiar with javascript and typescript, while others are completely new to these technologies. We are focusing the first 2 weeks with getting familiar with javascript and typescript to progress to an MVP, and once that MVP is created we can focus on making the app more usable and functional as our coding skills strengthen. Everyone on the team is unfamiliar with React Native, so we are working together to create a collaborative Expo Go experience.
