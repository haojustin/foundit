Goal: Have more issues on the Kanban board that are smaller in magnitude
Experiment: Check the Kanban every day to make sure everyone has an active issue. 
Measurement: See if everyone has compelted an issue by the end of the week. 

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

We used the start/stop/continue process for the retro. I believe this retro went very smoothly and everyone participated well.
The retro went quickly because everyone largely agreed on the issues. 

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
