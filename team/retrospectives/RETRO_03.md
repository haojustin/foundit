# Date of Retrospective: 03/08/24
* Led by: Alex Castelein
* Present: Baimin, Alex, Victor, Kevin, Kendrick, Zixiao, Justin

Start
- any new stuff should follow design guidelines
- make sure to pull and check that it doesn't break anything before merge

What went well
- Continue communicating on Discord
- Actively pushing to Github
- Adding to the Kanban board
- Being good about deadlines

What didn't go well, should stop for final week
- Showing up to class late 
- Envisioning ideas that are too large and/or inconsistency in the vision for the project
- Merging PRs late caused some conflicts
- Some careless merging to main 

## Action item

* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
* a change/experiment: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
* a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve the goal, or move closer to it.

Goal: Make sure that any changes to the code and especially UI follow the guidelines that we set for the UI design
Experiment: Check Design.md before coding to remind yourself about the guidelines.
Measurement: When merging make sure that UI design matches guidelines. 

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

We used the start/stop/continue process for the retro, but altered it a little bit since it is the last retro. Here the stop part was 
more of an exercise to think about what we could've done better in the process of our project earlier. The continue part was more of an
exercise to think about what we were doing well in our project.

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?

The experiment didn't change our workflow much, and it just made it a little more stressful. Because of that, we are deciding not to go through with the change.
