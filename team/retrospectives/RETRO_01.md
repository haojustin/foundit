## Action item

* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
* a change/experiment: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
* a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve the goal, or move closer to it.

Goal: Better communication outside of class time
Experiment: Daily check-ins on discord about the progress or blockers
Measurement: Everyone has a similar understanding on where we are as a group. We can also all discuss how we feel about the progres and communication.

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

We used the start/stop/continue process for the retro. I believe that it went well and that we all understand where each group member where everyone is struggling a bit or where everyone is making good progress. I think alot of good points were made during the stop/stop/continue and some were similar which really shows that the group all have very similar concerns or things that they think we are doing well. One advice I would give to the next person leading the retro is to spend more time on stops because I feel that groups usually don't make as many stops as the other options.

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
