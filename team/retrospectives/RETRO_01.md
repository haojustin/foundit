## Action item

* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
* a change/experiment: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
* a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve the goal, or move closer to it.

Goal: Better communication outside of class time
Experiment: Daily check-ins on discord about the progress or blockers
Measurement: Everyone has a similar understanding on where we are as a group. We can also all discuss how we feel about the progres and communication.

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

We used the start/stop/continue process for the retro. I believe that it went well and that we all understand where each group member where everyone is struggling a bit or where everyone is making good progress. I think a lot of good points were made during the stop/stop/continue and some were similar which shows that the group all have very similar concerns or things that they think we are doing well. I would advise the next person leading the retro to spend more time on stops because groups usually don't make as many stops as the other options.

## Experiment/Change

* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?

Our experiment was to communicate more by having the group use Discord every day to make check-ins and progress. This experiment improved things within our group because everyone was making better progress since we were helping each other with blockers outside of class rather than waiting until class time. Some group members even had time to meet up outside of class and communicated the meet-up through Discord. Going forward we will continue to use discord to communicate daily about progress and blockers.
