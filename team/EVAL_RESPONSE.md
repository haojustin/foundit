1) As for the UI, they could format the location data to be more clear and maybe show it in a map instead of just stating the coordinate data. 

Response: We have already added a feature to change the location to a street address instead of a coordinate.

2) I like how you can drag around a map, it would be nice if you could search in the map, and then get moved to that location where you can drag 
the pin for more a specific location. Other features could be the money aspect of foundit. Once someone puts a bounty on their item, maybe the 
application can hold that money and then grant it to the person who found the item.

Response: We don't believe that the having the app hold the money because we want the people to interact in persons to decide the rewards since
most of the people using this should be students.

3) Maybe deleting items...?

Response: We will try to add deleteing post before the code freeze

4) I think the most necessary feature would be to drop the pin at 'current location.' 

Response: We think that this is a good idea that will make it easier to make post and we will try to add it.

5) About the post feature's UX: I don't love the pastel colors in the background of the colors, it's a little dull and could be cleaner. 
I think that the search button being a bright cyan is also a little jarring. A different font for the cards would also be nice.
For the location feature, the drop a pin functionality is pretty cool and I like it, but if I've lost something, I don't think that 
I'll have that precise of an idea of where I lost it. Some kind of a radius would be good, I think.

Response: We have already fixed a lot of UX colors and formating and will make a PR soon. For the location we do have a radius feature which just 
hasn't been integrated yet.
